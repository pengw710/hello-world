Hello Data World!

Peng here, I like numbers and am extremly curious about the meanings behind numbers.
I'm quiet when I'm thinking but I'm talktive once I have insights to share.
These are typical attitudes for being a data analyst and a future data scientist.

Currently I'm studying online, accompanied by my two kids they are attending their schools online too.
See below picture of our HomeCampus.
